# Grex DS for Flutter

This project was born based on the need to create a Design System to be used within Grex. The components are written using the Flutter Framework.

## Setup

### Permissions

If you're using the `GrxUserAvatar` widget with the editable feature (camera and gallery access), you need to configure platform-specific permissions. See [PERMISSIONS_SETUP.md](PERMISSIONS_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.
